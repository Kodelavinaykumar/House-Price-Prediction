🏡 House Price Prediction:
✅ Project Goal
To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices based on features like location, area, number of bedrooms, and other parameters.

🔍 Problem Statement
Real estate buyers and sellers often need a way to estimate the value of a house based on historical and real-time data. A predictive model can aid in making informed decisions and avoiding under/overpricing.

📊 Key Features
Input Features (Independent Variables):

Location

Size (in sqft)

Number of bedrooms (BHK)

Number of bathrooms

Year built

Parking spaces

Nearby facilities (schools, hospitals)

Output Feature (Target Variable):

Predicted Price of the house (in local currency)

Model Features:

Handles categorical and numerical data

Real-time price prediction based on user input

Visualization of data trends

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
Linear Regression (basic model)

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

XGBoost / LightGBM (for performance)

Optional: Neural Networks (Keras/TensorFlow)

🏗️ System Architecture
Frontend (optional for web app):

HTML/CSS/JavaScript or React.js

Streamlit for quick UI

Backend:

Python (Flask or FastAPI)

Trained ML model loaded via pickle or joblib

Database (optional):

SQLite or MongoDB (to store past searches or user inputs)

Deployment:

Heroku / AWS / Render / Streamlit Cloud

📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle (e.g., Bengaluru House Data)

Format: CSV

Data Cleaning Needed:

Remove outliers

Handle missing/null values

Convert categorical features using Label/OneHot Encoding

🔄 Workflow
Load and clean dataset

Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Encode categorical variables

Split into train/test sets

Train ML models

Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, R²

Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit

📉 Evaluation Metrics
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)

R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
